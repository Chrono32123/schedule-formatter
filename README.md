## What is Stream Share?

Stream Share is a web tool that transforms your Livestream schedule into a shareable images and Discord-ready timestamps. Whether you're a streamer, moderator, or community manager, Stream Share makes it easy to keep your audience informed about upcoming streams across all platforms.

**Perfect for:**
- Streamers who want to share their schedule on social media
- Community managers coordinating multiple channels
- Anyone who wants visual flair without design software

## How It Works

Stream Share gives you two ways to create your schedule, then converts it into shareable formats:

1. **Schedule Images** – Polished PNG graphics perfect for Twitter, Instagram, or Discord announcements
2. **Discord Timestamps** – Copy-paste formatted timestamps that automatically adjust to each viewer's timezone

### Quick Start

**Option 1: Use your Twitch schedule**

1. Set up your schedule on your [Twitch Dashboard](https://dashboard.twitch.tv) (**Settings → Channel → Schedule**)
2. Visit [Stream Share](https://chrono32123.github.io/schedule-formatter/)
3. Enter your Twitch username
4. Choose your export format:
   - **Copy Discord Timestamps** – Click to copy formatted text for Discord
   - **Generate Image** – Download a PNG to share anywhere

**Option 2: Create your own schedule**

1. Visit [Stream Share](https://chrono32123.github.io/schedule-formatter/)
2. Click **"Create Schedule"** to manually add events
3. Enter stream titles, dates, times, and categories
4. Export as images or Discord timestamps

Perfect for non-Twitch streamers or anyone who doesn't use Twitch's calendar feature!
